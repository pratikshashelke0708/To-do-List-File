# To-do-List-File
Pratiksha Shelke

1. Structure:
Input: User enters a new task.
Storage: Tasks are stored in a list/array (can be saved locally or in a database).
Operations: Add, edit, delete, mark as complete.
Output: Display all tasks in a list format, optionally separating completed and pending tasks.

2. Styling:
Simple, clean interface for easy reading.
Use colors, checkboxes, or strikethrough to indicate completed tasks.
Clear buttons/icons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

3. Logic:
When a task is added → store it and display in the list.
When a task is marked complete → update status and style it differently.
When editing → replace old task with new input.
When deleting → remove task from the list/storage.
Optional: Save tasks locally so they remain after closing the app.

4. Tools/Tags Used:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or Python for console version)
Functions: For adding, deleting, editing, and updating tasks
DOM Manipulation: To dynamically display tasks (for web version)
Local Storage / Database: To save tasks persistently
